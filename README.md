# fnf chart 2 video
you put in an fnf (currently friday again garfie baby only) chart
and pop goes a 60fps video!

credit goes to [WizardMantis441](https://github.com/WizardMantis441) for the idea by the way lol
they originally made the script one day and i decided today to try to make my own spin on it

my version works on a mini "game engine" of sorts with sprites and everything, except
that instead of running in realtime on a window, it's running in a perfect 60fps scenario
outputting to a video

it's weird but to me seems a bit more flexible than hardcoding everything

## planned things:
- characters singing they shit! [ ]
- maybe stages??? [ ]
- very maybe health bar??? [ ]
